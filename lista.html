    <h1>Type of Hair</h1>

        <dt>Curly Type 2A-C</dt>
        <dd>2A: Super loose waves that add a touch of texture to the hair.
          • 2B: Loose “S” shaped waves that begin to form around the middle 
          to end of the hair.
          • 2C: “S” shaped waves that start closer to the crown and travel all the way 
          to the ends. There may even be some perfect ringlets among them.
           </dd><br><br>

       
        <dt>Curly Type 3A-C</dt>
        <dd> If you have curly hair, you have spiral or ringlet curls that appear consistent 
          throughout your hair. The three different patterns of curly hair are defined as: 
          ‌• 3A: Wide, bouncy, spiral-shaped curls that travel from root to tip. 
          • 3B: Tighter, springy spirals all over the head that provide a lot of body and volume. 
          • 3C: Very tight, corkscrew-like spiral ringlets that are densely grouped throughout the hair.
   ‌        </dd> <br><br>

        
        <dt>Curly Type 4A-C</dt>
        <dd> If you have coily hair, your curls are the tightest of the bunch. 
          ‌
          • 4A: Small, tight coils that start at the root and maintain texture throughout the hair. 
          • 4B: Very tight coils that sometimes form in a “Z” shape or zig-zag pattern. This curl type is more prone to shrinkage, 
          when hair appears much shorter in length than it really is.
          • 4C: The tightest of coils that have a defined zig-zag pattern and a dense texture that’s most prone to shrinkage.
